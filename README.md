## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict movie ratings based on user preferences, movie features, and historical ratings. The model can be used for recommendation systems to enhance user experience.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Movie ID**: Unique identifier for each movie.
- **Rating**: User's rating for the movie (target variable).
- **Features**: Metadata such as movie genre, release year, and user demographic data.

## Installation

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# For Linux/Mac:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# For Windows:
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate

This provides the correct code format for the **Installation** section in the `README.md` file. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
## Usage

### Running the Analysis:
Open the Jupyter Notebook at `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to explore the data, feature engineering, and modeling.

### To train the model from scratch:
```bash
python src/model.py

This is now in the appropriate format for your `README.md`. Let me know if you need further changes!


## Models and Results

### Models Used:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

```bash
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier




### Key Metrics:

| Metric     | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| RMSE       | 95%                 | 85%           |
| R² Score   | 78%                 | 84%           |

The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression with better accuracy and robustness.
